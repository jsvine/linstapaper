## Generating the site

To generate the Linstapaper homepage, you must have Node.js and the npm package manager installed. To install the site-generator's three package-dependencies, run:

	make install dependencies

To generate the site, run:

	make compile

Open `src/index.html` in your favorite browser to see the generated homepage. If you're happy with it, run the following command to push the compiled files to the `dist/` directory:

	make dist

Now you can serve the `dist/` folder with your favorite static-file server.
